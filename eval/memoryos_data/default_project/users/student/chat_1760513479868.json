For example, are you referring to the number itself, a code, or something else?  \n\nIf you mean the number **123**, it’s a simple sequence of consecutive integers — one, two, three — often used as an example in counting or ordering.  \n\nPlease share a bit more context so I can give a more specific and helpful answer!",
