      "content": "The number **2113** has a few key properties and contexts worth noting:\n\n\n### 1. **Mathematical Facts**\n- **Prime Number**: 2113 is a **prime number** (it has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself). To confirm, since its square root is ~45.97, we only need to check divisibility by primes up to 43—none divide 2113 evenly.\n- **Odd & Positive**: It’s an odd, positive integer (ends in 3).\n\n\n### 2. **Chronological Context**\n- **Year**: 2113 is a future year (as of 2024). It will be a **common year** (not a leap year) starting on a **Monday** (if the Gregorian calendar remains in use).\n\n\n### 3. **Other Possible Contexts**\nWithout additional details, it could also be:\n- A **reference number** (e.g., product code, ticket ID, or serial number).\n- A **numerical code** (e.g., in games, puzzles, or cryptography).\n\n\nIf you’re referring to a specific context (e.g., a game, a date, or a code), let me know and I can refine this further!",
