      "content": "“**gpt-5-chat-latest**” refers to the most recent publicly available version of OpenAI’s GPT‑5 model configured for chat-based interactions. It’s part of the GPT‑5 family, which succeeds GPT‑4 and GPT‑4 Turbo.  \n\nIf you’re using a platform like ChatGPT, selecting **gpt-5-chat-latest** generally means you’ll be interacting with the newest, most capable chat model OpenAI has released—optimized for reasoning, conversation quality, and access to up‑to‑date features like improved memory, multimodal understanding (text, images, possibly other inputs), and more efficient performance compared to earlier versions.\n\nIn short:\n- **“gpt-5”** → the model generation.  \n- **“chat”** → optimized for conversational use.  \n- **“latest”** → the newest stable release available at the time.\n\nWould you like me to summarize the main differences between GPT‑4 and GPT‑5?",
