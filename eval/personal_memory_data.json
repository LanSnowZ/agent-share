        { "role": "student2", "content": "Maybe a thriller. But I want to avoid the common pitfalls, you know? Like a weak third act or obvious twists." },
        { "role": "ai", "content": "Definitely. A common pitfall in thrillers is poor pacing. A good practical tip is to check reviews for keywords like 'slow burn' vs 'edge-of-your-seat' to match your preference." },
        { "role": "student2", "content": "That's a good tip. Do you have a code example? Like, what's a movie that implements the 'good thriller' architecture well?" },
        { "role": "ai", "content": "Think of 'Parasite' as a great example. Its plot is well-structured, the tension escalates logically, and the payoff is strong. It avoids the pitfall of revealing too much too early." },

        { "role": "ai", "content": "Over-scheduling is a classic one. People pack their itinerary too tightly and end up exhausted. A best practice is to have one 'anchor' activity per day and leave the rest flexible." },

        { "role": "ai", "content": "Super easy. The whole story is: Paddington wants to buy a gift, the gift gets stolen, and he has to find out who did it. Simple, fun, and no unexplained jargon!" },
        { "role": "student", "content": "That sounds perfect. A small, easy-to-digest story. It's like you're giving me the 'Hello, World!' of movies." },
